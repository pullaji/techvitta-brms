# Complete Fix: Remove Dummy Data and Show Real Excel Transactions

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your Excel file uploads successfully, but the transactions page shows dummy/static transactions instead of the actual data from your Excel file.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The database contains dummy transactions from previous setup scripts and test files. These dummy transactions are being displayed instead of your real Excel data.

## ✅ **Complete Solution**

### **Step 1: Remove All Dummy Data from Database**

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy and paste the contents of `database/REMOVE_DUMMY_TRANSACTIONS.sql`**
4. **Click Run**

This will:
- ✅ Remove all test transactions
- ✅ Remove dummy transactions with names like "Test Transaction", "Malakala Venkatesh", "Dasari Taranga Naveen"
- ✅ Remove transactions with dummy amounts (100.00, 1000.00, 20000.00, etc.)
- ✅ Remove transactions with dummy source files (test.xlsx, sample.xlsx)
- ✅ Show you exactly what was removed

### **Step 2: Hard Refresh Your Browser**

1. **Press Ctrl+F5** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to clear browser cache
2. **This ensures the new code is loaded**

### **Step 3: Upload Your Excel File Again**

1. **Upload your Excel file**
2. **Watch the console for these success messages:**
   ```
   ✅ Excel processing completed: X transactions processed
   📊 Excel mapped transactions: [array of real transactions]
   ✅ Successfully extracted X real transactions from Excel file: your-file.xlsx
   🔄 Starting to create X transactions...
   ✅ Transaction X created successfully
   🎉 Transaction creation completed: X/X successful
   ```

### **Step 4: Check Transactions Page**

1. **Go to the Transactions page**
2. **Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)**
3. **You should now see your real Excel transactions**
