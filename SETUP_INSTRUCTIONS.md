# Setup Instructions for PDF Reports

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **Fixed "doc.autoTable is not a function" error** - Updated jsPDF autoTable import and usage
2. **Fixed table width warning** - Adjusted column widths in PDF generation
3. **Added graceful error handling** - PDF generation now works even if database/storage setup is incomplete
4. **Created database setup script** - Complete setup for saved_reports table and storage bucket

## Quick Setup (Optional - for full functionality)

To enable the complete PDF reports functionality with database storage, run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database/COMPLETE_SETUP_FIX.sql
```

Or run the individual setup files:
1. `database/setup-saved-reports.sql` - Creates the saved_reports table
2. The storage bucket will be created automatically when first used

## What Works Now âœ…

- **PDF Generation**: The Save button now works and generates PDF reports
- **Local Download**: PDF files are downloaded to your computer
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if database/storage isn't set up
- **Table Layout**: Fixed table width warnings in PDF generation

## What the Setup Adds (Optional) ðŸ“Š

- **Database Storage**: Saves report metadata to database
- **Cloud Storage**: Uploads PDFs to Supabase storage
- **Reports Page**: View saved reports in the Reports section
- **User Permissions**: Proper RLS policies for data security

## Testing

1. Go to the Transactions page
2. Click the "Save" button
3. PDF should download successfully
4. Check browser console - should see success messages instead of errors

The system now works with or without the database setup - the PDF generation is the core functionality that's been fixed!
