# 🔧 Proof Button Update - "Upload the proof" Text Added

## ✅ **Changes Made**

I've updated the `InlineProofUpload` component to show a proper button with text instead of just an icon.

### **Before:**
```
[📤]  ← Just a small upload icon
```

### **After:**
```
[📤 Upload the proof]  ← Button with icon and text
```

## 📋 **What Changed**

### **File:** `src/components/InlineProofUpload.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Changed button variant from `ghost` to `outline`
- Increased button height from `h-6` to `h-8`
- Added padding `px-3` for better spacing
- Added text "Upload the proof" with icon
- Improved styling with better borders and hover effects

### **Button Styling:**
- **Size:** Small but readable
- **Color:** Primary blue with outline border
- **Text:** "Upload the proof" with upload icon
- **Hover:** Enhanced border and text color

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

### **Empty State (No Proof):**
```
[📤 Upload the proof]  ← Clear, clickable button
```

### **After Upload (With Proof):**
```
[🖼️ View] [❌]  ← View link + Remove button
```

## 📱 **Mobile & Desktop**

The change applies to both:
- **Desktop table view** - Proof column
- **Mobile card view** - Proof section

Both will now show the "Upload the proof" button instead of just an icon.

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Refresh your transactions page**
2. **Look for transactions without proof**
3. **Verify you see "Upload the proof" button**
4. **Click the button to test upload functionality**
5. **Check both desktop and mobile views**

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

- ✅ Button shows "Upload the proof" text
- ✅ Button has upload icon (📤)
- ✅ Button is clickable and opens file picker
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

---

**The update is complete! Your proof column will now show clear "Upload the proof" buttons instead of just icons.**
