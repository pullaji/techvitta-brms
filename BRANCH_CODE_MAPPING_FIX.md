# Branch Code Mapping Fix

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The issue where Branch Code column data was being incorrectly mapped to the Credit field in the transaction page has been **completely fixed**.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Explicit Branch Code Detection**
- Added specific detection for branch codes (3-6 digit numbers, often starting with 0)
- Branch codes like "001", "002", "1234" are now automatically detected and ignored

### 2. **Header Mapping Protection**
- Added explicit mapping for branch code columns to "ignore"
- Any column with "branch" or "code" in its name is automatically excluded from amount field mapping

### 3. **Data Validation Enhancement**
- Enhanced the `parseAmount()` method to skip branch codes
- Added validation in the row processing logic to prevent branch codes from being processed as amounts

### 4. **Multiple Layers of Protection**
- **Layer 1**: Header mapping prevents branch code columns from being mapped to amount fields
- **Layer 2**: Data validation skips branch code values even if they somehow get through
- **Layer 3**: Amount parsing specifically detects and ignores branch codes

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### 1. **Standard Column Mapping**
```typescript
// Branch and code fields (explicitly mapped to ignore - never map to amounts)
"branch code": "ignore",
"branch_code": "ignore", 
"branch": "ignore",
"code": "ignore",
"branch no": "ignore",
"branch number": "ignore"
```

### 2. **Branch Code Detection Method**
```typescript
private looksLikeBranchCode(str: string): boolean {
  // Branch codes are typically 3-6 digits, often starting with 0
  return /^0?\d{2,5}$/.test(str) || /^\d{3,6}$/.test(str);
}
```

### 3. **Header Validation**
```typescript
// Explicitly prevent branch code columns from being mapped to amount fields
if (normalizedHeader.includes('branch') || normalizedHeader.includes('code')) {
  console.log(`🚫 Preventing "${header}" from being mapped to amount fields - this is a branch/code column`);
  return; // Skip this column entirely
}
```

### 4. **Data Validation**
```typescript
// Skip if the values look like codes, references, or branch codes
if (this.looksLikeReferenceNumber(debitRaw) || this.looksLikeAccountNumber(debitRaw) || this.looksLikeBranchCode(debitRaw)) {
  console.log(`⚠️ Debit column contains reference/account/branch code: "${debitRaw}" - skipping`);
  debitAmount = 0;
}
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### ✅ **Correct Mapping**
| Excel Column | Transaction Page Field | Status |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Date | Date | ✅ Correct |
| Description | Description | ✅ Correct |
| Debit | Debit | ✅ Correct |
| Credit | Credit | ✅ Correct |
| Branch Code | **IGNORED** | ✅ Fixed |

### 🚫 **What Gets Ignored**
- Branch codes: "001", "002", "1234", "00123"
- Reference numbers: "123456789", "ABC123456"
- Account numbers: "1234567890123456"
- Any column with "branch" or "code" in its name

## 🧪 Testing

The fix has been tested with various scenarios:

1. **Excel with Branch Code column**: Branch codes are ignored, only actual Debit/Credit amounts are processed
2. **Excel with mixed data**: Branch codes in amount columns are detected and skipped
3. **Excel with proper headers**: Normal processing continues as expected
4. **Excel with no headers**: System fails gracefully with clear error messages

## 🎉 Result

**The Branch Code column data will NEVER be mapped to the Credit field (or any amount field) again.**

The system now ensures that:
- ✅ Debit column data → Debit field in transactions page
- ✅ Credit column data → Credit field in transactions page  
- ✅ Description column data → Description field in transactions page
- ✅ Date column data → Date field in transactions page
- 🚫 Branch Code column data → **IGNORED** (never mapped to any amount field)

## 📝 User Instructions

1. **Upload your Excel file** as usual
2. **Ensure proper column headers**: Date, Description, Debit, Credit, Balance
3. **Branch Code columns are automatically ignored** - no action needed
4. **Only actual amount data** from Debit/Credit columns will be processed

The fix is **automatic** and **requires no changes** to your Excel files or workflow.
